<h3 id="planning">Tips for planning a successful experiment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you have a question or objective in mind when designing
  your experiments.
  </li>

  <li>Test one attribute at a time to get the clearest results, but test
  similar changes in icons and feature graphics together, for example comparing
  use of character art against objects from a game.
  </li>

  <li>Start testing with your app icon, because it can have a huge impact on
  whether users pick your app from search results and category lists.
  </li>

  <li>Test all of your listing’s attributes; after icons, test screenshots and
  short descriptions as they are seen by users from search results and category
  lists. Test the feature graphic as a priority, as it has such a presence on
  your store listing’s page.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="graphics">Tips for your graphics and text</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create up to three alternatives for your hi-res icon, feature graphic,
  screenshots, promo video, short description, and full description.
  </li>

  <li>Set up a Global experiment for graphics against your default language or
  a Localized experiment for both text and graphics in a specific language.
  Experiment with screenshots and their order.
  </li>

  <li>Be bold about testing different artwork, but iterate on the results to
  confirm and improve your findings.
  </li>

  <li>Make sure short descriptions clearly demonstrate an app or game’s value
  to users.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="success">Tips for running successful experiments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Test one asset at a time, unless testing completely different designs for
  a store listing page against one another.
  </li>

  <li>Run your experiment for at least 7 days, even if you have enough traffic
  to get meaningful results in a few days. Depending on the percentage of your
  audience you’re showing the experiment too and the traffic on your listings
  page it may take anything from a few days to several weeks to get a
  result.
  </li>

  <li>Run your experiments with 50 percent of your audience, the maximum
  allowed, to get results faster; particularly for localized tests that may be
  visible to only a small percentage of your users.
  </li>

  <li>Check the banner on the Experiments page to see progress. Once enough
  data has been collected the winner is displayed and you can apply it to your
  store listing.
  </li>
</ul>
