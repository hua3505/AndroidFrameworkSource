  Play games services into Doctor Who: Legacy. Achievements were supported with
  beautifully designed and customized badges to encourage players to unlock. To
  delight users with quick wins, achievements can be unlocked from within the
  first play session. In addition, percentage progress updates keep players
  motivated.

  "Google Play has been a tremendous partner of ours in our launch and support
  of Doctor Who: Legacy, which to date remains our most successful platform in
  terms of downloads and revenue. Integration of cloud services and achievements
  dramatically improved our daily revenues and we continue to look to add
  additional services like the newly announced Google Quests," says Susan
