  Concrete Software makes use of Google Play games services in its 10-pin
  bowling game,
  <a class="external-link"
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.concretesoftware.pbachallenge_androidmarket">
  PBA Bowling Challenge</a>. Once users have signed in with Google Play games
  services they’re able to take part in multiplayer games, view leaderboards,
  and gain achievements.
</p>


<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  To offer players new game content, Concrete Software implemented Google Play
  games services quests. Easily accessible from the game’s home screen, quests
  are designed with clear goals that integrated into in-game goals and core
  experience. Each quest stated rewards; offered a progress tracker, which
  updates as users advance; gave a clear deadline; and a call to action button.
  Both short-term and long-term quests were offered to users.

<p>
  Quests appealed most to dedicated users, and yet there is still an increase
  in their engagement after using quests. <b>Sessions per user improved 14.4
  percent</b> DoD upon quests acceptance, and <b>3.7 percent</b> DoD upon
  completion. While users who accepted a quest <b>started 98 percent more
  sessions per day</b>; users who completed a quest <b>started 140.2 percent
  </b> more.
</p>

<p>
  Concrete Software also found that quest acceptance and completion rates
  increased overtime, while daily active users (DAU) remained constant. Among
  users who accepted the first quest, almost <b>48% of the users accepted a
  second</b> quest. Among those who completed the first, <b>78% accepted a
  second</b>.
</p>

<p>
  Quests also had a positive impact on retention with one day retention for
  users who accepted a quest being <b>39.2 percent higher</b> than the average;
  for users who completed a quest, it’s <b>60.7 percent higher</b> than the
  average.
