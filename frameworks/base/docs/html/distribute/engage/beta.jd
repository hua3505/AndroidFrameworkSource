<p>
  With alpha or beta tests run from the Developer Console you can collect user
  feedback on early versions of your app, then make improvements and correct
  issues before you release to the full Play Store audience.

<p>Testing your app with a select group of users will give you a chance to fix any technical or user experience issues before you release it widely, so that you can be confident about releasing the best version of your app to the majority of your users. Feedback from your test users won't affect your app’s public rating.</p>

<h2 id="how-to">How to Do It</h2>

<ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Open beta —</strong> Use an open beta when you want any user who
    has the link to be able to join your beta with just one click. One of the
    advantages of an open beta is that it allows you to scale to a large number
    of testers. However, you can also limit the maximum number of users who can
    join.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Closed beta using email addresses —</strong> If you want to
    restrict which users can access your beta, you have a new option: you can
    now set up a closed beta using lists of individual email addresses which
    you can add individually or upload as a .csv file. These users will be able
    to join your beta via a one-click opt-in link.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Closed beta with Google+ community or Google Group —</strong> You
    can continue to use betas with Google+ communities or Google Groups. You
    can also move closed betas to an open beta while maintaining your existing
    testers.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your testers will need to have a Google Account (<code>@gmail.com</code>)
  or a Google Apps account to join a test.
  </li>

  <li>Use alpha tests for early experimental versions of your app that might
  contain incomplete or unstable functionality, and use beta tests for apps
  that should be complete and stable.
  </li>

  <li>Start testing with a small group of more trusted testers in an alpha
  test, then expand your test to a larger group of testers in a beta test.
  </li>

  <li>Testers can't leave public reviews for alpha/beta apps on Google Play, so
  include a feedback channel or provide the option to send feedback by email,
  website, or a message forum.
  </li>

  <li>For an APK to be available to alpha testers it must have a higher version
  number than your beta or production version, and for beta testers the APK
  must have a higher version number than your production version.
  </li>

  <li>Alpha testers receive the alpha, beta, or production version of your app
  with the highest version code that is compatible with their device, while
  beta testers receive the beta or production version of your app with the
  highest version code that is compatible with their device. This also means
  that posting a higher version number APK cancels earlier tests of earlier
  versions, so posting a production 2.0 version would cancel a beta test of
  version 1.9 and that beta test would have canceled an alpha test of version
  1.8.
