  Every Android app runs in a limited-access sandbox. If an app needs to use
  resources or information outside of its own sandbox, the app has to request
  the appropriate <i>permission.</i> You declare that your app needs a
  permission by listing the permission in the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">App Manifest</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Depending on how sensitive the permission is, the system might grant the
  permission automatically, or the device user might have to grant
  the request. For example, if your app requests permission to turn on the
  device's flashlight, the system grants that permission automatically. But
  if your app needs to read the user's contacts, the system asks the user
  to approve that permission. Depending on the platform version, the user
  grants the permission either when they install the app (on Android 5.1 and
  lower) or while running the app (on Android 6.0 and higher).
</p>

<h2 id="perm-needed">Determine What Permissions Your App Needs</h2>

<p>
  As you develop your app, you should note when your app is using capabilities
  that require a permission. Typically, an app is going to need permissions
  whenever it uses information or resources that the app doesn't create, or
  performs actions that affect the behavior of the device or other apps. For
  example, if an app needs to access the internet, use the device camera, or
  turn Wi-Fi on or off, the app needs the appropriate permission. For a list of
  system permissions, see <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/security/permissions.html#normal-dangerous">Normal
  and Dangerous Permissions</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Your app only needs permissions for actions that it performs directly. Your
  app does not need permission if it is requesting that another app perform the
  task or provide the information. For example, if your app needs to read the
  user's address book, the app needs the {@link
  android.Manifest.permission#READ_CONTACTS READ_CONTACTS} permission. But if
  your app uses an <em>intent</em> to request information from the user's
  Contacts app, your app does not need any permissions, but the
  Contacts app <em>does</em> need to have that permission. For more
  information, see <a href="best-practices.html#perms-vs-intents">Consider
  Using an Intent</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="perm-add">Add Permissions to the Manifest</h2>

<p>
  To declare that your app needs a permission, put a <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-permission-element.html"
  ><code>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</code></a>
  element in your <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">app manifest</a>, as a
  child of the top-level <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html"><code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code></a>
  element. For example, an app that needs to send SMS messages would have this
  line in the manifest:
</p>

<pre>&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        package="com.example.snazzyapp"&gt;

    <strong>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/&gt;</strong>
    <!-- other permissions go here -->

    &lt;application ...&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/application&gt;

&lt;/manifest&gt;</pre>

<p>
  The system's behavior after you declare a permission depends on how sensitive
  the permission is. If the permission does not affect user privacy, the system
  grants the permission automatically. If the permission might grant access to
  sensitive user information, the system asks the user to approve the request.
  For more information about the different kinds of permissions, see
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/security/permissions.html#normal-dangerous">Normal
  and Dangerous Permissions</a>.
