<p>
  While translating your store listing and universal app campaign ads (if you have any) can make
  your app more discoverable, providing a translated user interface and in-app purchase products
  can maximize user engagement and retention. Depending on your budget, there are several
  options available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Use the Google Play App Translation Service</strong>: For your convenience, Google Play
    provides an <a href="https://support.google.com/l10n/answer/6359997">App Translation Service</a>
    that is integrated directly into the <a href="https://support.google.com/l10n/answer/6341304">
    Developer Console</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/l10n/answer/6341928">Android
    Studio</a>. Using this professional, human service, you can order translations for your app,
    store listing text, in-app purchase products, and universal app campaign ads all in one go.
    Youâ€™ll get instant estimates from multiple vendors, all with the convenience of ordering and
    paying online.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Do it yourself</strong>: If you or your colleagues know the target languages, you can
    translate everything yourself using any text editor, or you can use the
    <a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/androidstudio087released">Android Studio Translation
    Editor</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Use a third-party translation service</strong>: You can use a translation service
    that is offered by one of the many translation companies available online.
  </li>
</ul>
