<p>
  Found in 2001, Glu  Mobile is a leading global developer and publisher of
  free-to-play games for smartphone and tablet devices.
</p>

<p>
  The company makes extensive use of Google Play games services across its
  portfolio: in Eternity Warriors 3 this includes sign-in, leaderboards,
  achievements, and multiplayer games features.
</p>


<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  To help drive installs and player engagement, Glu added games gifts to
  Eternity Warriors 3. They made this new feature accessible from the home
  screen, providing it exposure by grouping it with similar “freebies” options.
  In addition, so not to interrupt the in-game experience, they implemented an
  automatic transition back to the gifting screen after sending requests.
</p>

<p>
  To promote the addition of games gifts Glu:
  <ul>
    <li>sent push notifications to users telling them about the gifting feature.
    </li>
    <li>showed a full screen in-game screen promoting the gifting feature.</li>
    <li>ran promos during promo events.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Glu went a step further by integrating friends invites into the gifts UI,
  with the option easily accessible in the Gifting screen.
</p>

  Glu found that the gifting feature has a very high response rate and the gift
  requests’ <b>fulfillment rate doubled</b> within 30 days of the feature’s
  launch. Also these rates continued to increase over time among Eternity
  Warriors 3 players.
