<p>
  Founded in early 2011, Noodlecake Studios is an indie game studio based in
  Canada. Noodlecake found success with its first game, Super Stickman Golf.
  Since then they have expanded into publishing and releasing games on multiple
  platforms.
</p>

<p>
  For the update to Super Stickman Golf Noodlecake made extensive use of
  Google Play games services.
</p>

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  In
  <a class="external-link"
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.ssg2">
  Super Stickman Golf 2</a> Noodlecake implemented a game open screen that
  prompts the user to sign in, with a clear value proposition. Once the user has
  signed in, they’re given the option to auto sign-in in the future. For users
  who don’t select this option, sign-in is prominently displayed on the game’s
  home screen.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to achievements, the main Google Play games services feature in
  Super Stickman Golf 2 is multiplayer. Users have two multiplayer options:
  turn based or race mode,  which engage with different types of players.
  Players can find an opponent among their friends or one at random to start a
  game immediately. And to minimize drop-off asynchronous gameplay starts
  immediately after an invite is issued.
</p>

<p>
  Noodlecake found that user acquisition, retention, and engagement positively
  correlated with the use of Google Play Games by players. This is consistent
  across different games and genres, not just for Stickman Golf 2.
</p>

<p>
  Also multiplayer, in addition to increasing user engagement, is also an
  effective user acquisition channel.
</p>

<p>
  Some key metrics include:
  <ul>
    <li>~96 percent increase in the number of users after Google Play games
    services integration.</li>
    <li>~26 percent decrease in the user attrition rate.</li>
    <li>~6 percent increase in session length.</li>
  </ul>
