     *
     * Once a stream is successfully registered to this buffer manager, the buffer manager takes
     * over the buffer allocation role and provides buffers to this stream via getBufferForStream().

     * ANativeWindow (Surface) for downstream consumer to acquire. Once the image buffer is released
     * by the consumer end point, the BufferQueueProducer callback onBufferReleased will call
     * returnBufferForStream() to return the free buffer to this buffer manager. If the stream
