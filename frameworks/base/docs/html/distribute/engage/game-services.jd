  Google Play game services save you from implementing popular game features
  yourself such as achievements, leaderboards, real-time multiplayer, and
  others. You can also let players sign in using their Google identity and
  share their gaming experience with friends. And there is comprehensive
  reporting and statistics to help you track and improve your game’s
  performance.
