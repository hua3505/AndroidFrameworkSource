  Store Listing Experiments</a> to see if
  different game screenshots could impact installs. They found that game
  screenshots showing gameplay mechanics drove more installs from the store
  listing page than their existing non-gameplay screenshots.
</p>

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  Dots used a localized store listing experiment in the Google Play Developer
  Console to test Two Dots screenshots in the US. They targeted 50 percent of
  users with non-gameplay screenshots (the “control”) and the other 50 percent
  with gameplay screenshots, to see how graphically demonstrating gameplay would
  impact installs.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  The results revealed that screenshots showing gameplay mechanics drove 6
  percent more installs than the control group using non-gameplay screenshots.

<p>
  In a follow up experiment they tested whether including text emphasizing
  gameplay performed better than screenshots without text. The results showed
  that screenshots with text highlighting gameplay had an 8 percent increase in
  installs compared to those without.

<p>
  Dots commented that “sometimes you have to step back and think about what your
  objective is: illustrate gameplay. So that’s what we did — and the simplest
  changes impacted our conversion by a huge percentage.”
