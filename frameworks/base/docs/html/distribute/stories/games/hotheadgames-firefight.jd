  Rivals at War: Firefight</a> they plan to include its features in all their
  games.

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  To start, the Google Play games services sign-in icon was given a prominent
  position on the home screen so it was clear and easily accessible. They then
  added leaderboards with their own beautifully designed badges as well as
  achievements. Both were aligned and displayed with related in-game missions
  showing players their progress and rewards earned. Notifications were used to
  give players instant gratification when achievements were unlocked.
