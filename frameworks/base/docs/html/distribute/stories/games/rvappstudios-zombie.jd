  Zombie Ragdoll</a> is a physics based zombie shooting game launched by RV AppStudios in August
  2013. Inspired by Google I/O talks about reaching global users on Google Play, the team at RV
  AppStudios was inspired to go global with Zombie Ragdoll at launch.
</p>


<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  Using the App Translation Service in the Google Play Developer Console,
  RV AppStudios launched Zombie Ragdoll localized into 20 languages.
  In addition to localizing the text within the game, they also localized
  game assets to specific countries and cultures.

  After launch 80% of downloads came from non-English speaking countries,
  improving engagement with users worldwide. In addition, there was
  growth in use in countries where their apps hadn’t been as popular
  before; achieving significant traction in countries such as Vietnam,
  Russia, Philippines, and Thailand.

  Vivek Dave, founder of RV AppStudios says, “Users want a personalized
  experience, and by offering a localized game with translation of text and
  graphic assets, we believe users will connect at a much deeper level.""
