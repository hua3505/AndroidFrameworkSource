  When the Android tablet guidelines came out, the team at Remember The Milk had
  already been thinking about a redesign for
  <a class="external-link"

  Remember The Milk</a> their feature-packed to-do list app; never forget the
  milk (or anything else) again.
</p>

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  “We took this as an opportunity to think about how we were going to approach
  Android tablets differently from a user experience perspective,” says Omar
  Kilani, Co-founder of Remember The Milk. “The guidelines were a helpful
  resource, and with the extra screen real estate tablets afford, users have
  the opportunity to see all of their data in context and drill down on more
  items."
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

  In addition to the basic changes to bring the app to tablets, the team also
  came out with a number of other goodies — including a new set of widgets and
  richer notifications, and more ways to provide an immersive experience for
  their users. And importantly, following the guidelines meant they could
  deliver a <b>single APK for phones and tablets</b>.

<p>
  Following the

  update</a> of the Android app, in part to meet the tablet design criteria,
  Remember The Milk saw an <b>83% increase in tablet installs</b>. They also
  noted that Nexus 7 was theat most popular Android device for the app.
</p>

<p>
  Omar Kilani, concludesd that “For us, designing for tablets was an investment that has really paid off.”
