<p>
  App developer TinyCo, makers of a suite of games such as Tiny Monsters,
  decided to prioritize launching effectively across multiple platforms. They
  chose Android as one of their primary launch platforms because of its large
  installed base and global reach. They also knew that the growing base of
  Android tablet users represented a huge opportunity.
</p>

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  <a class="external-link"
  href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinyco.village">
  Tiny Village</a>, a game targeting 7- to 10-inch tablets and phones, was their
  first title to take advantage of the strategy, and it proved to be a winning
  one — especially in terms of Android tablets.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  In the six months from launch TinyCo saw Android tablet <b>downloads more than
  triple</b>.
</p>

<p>
  When used on tablets Tiny Village also showed an increase in average revenue
  per paying user (ARPPU) — about 35% higher than on smaller-screen devices such
  as phones. Additionally, average revenue per user <b>(ARPU) is now about 35%
  higher</b> as well. “The game is just much more immersive on tablets,” said
  Rajeev Nagpal, Head of Product at TinyCo.
</p>

<p>
  There has also been a <b>consistent increase in retention</b> over other
  platforms, an important metric for games according to Nagpal.
</p>

<p>
  “With continued optimization of the gameplay experience and a genuine
  commitment to our Android offering through our Griffin engine, all of our
  metrics started to rise,” said Nagpal.
