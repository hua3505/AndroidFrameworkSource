<p>Users often invest significant time and effort creating data and setting
preferences within apps. Preserving that data for users if they replace a broken
device or upgrade to a new one is an important part of ensuring a great user
experience.</p>

<p>This class covers techniques for backing up data to the cloud so that
users can restore their data when recovering from a data loss (such as a factory
reset) or installing your application on a new device.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the API for cloud backup changed with the
release of Android 6.0 (API level 23). For your app to support backup both
on devices running Android 6.0, and those running Android 5.1 (API level
22) and lower, you must implement both techniques that this class explains.</p>
