  AdVenture Capitalist</a> a builder game from games developers HyperHippo and
  Kongregate, was originally built for the web and released as a mobile version
  in May 2015. Kongregate decided to use
  <a class="external-link"
  href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6227309">
  Store Listing Experiments</a> to see if different graphics
  could impact their installs. They found that graphics illustrating the game’s
  builder mechanics and strategy drove more installs from the store listing page
  than their existing graphics.

</p>

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  <a class="external-link"
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Kongregate">
  Kongregate</a> used a global store listing experiment in the Google Play
  Developer Console to test two variant designs of feature art. Their prediction
  was that their current control graphic would outperform the variant designs,
  because of the game’s brand and icon reputation on the web.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  The results revealed that variant graphics showing more of the game’s builder
  mechanics and strategy drove more installs compared to the existing branded
  icon.

  across all of our channels in a live environment, for free — it is now our
  primary tool for testing."
