  Global Assault</a> is a free-to-play, 3D strategy RPG developed and produced
  by Kongregate that was released in November 2014. Kongregate decided to use
  <a class="external-link"
  href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6227309">
  Store Listing Experiments</a> to see if different artwork could impact their
  installs. They found that icons illustrating dynamic game play drove more
  installs from the store listing page than their existing icon.
</p>

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
  <a class="external-link"
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Kongregate">
  Kongregate</a> used a global store listing experiment in the Google Play
  Developer Console to test three new icons. From previous internal tests, they
  believed that their existing icon, the control, would perform best in terms of
  installs.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  The results showed that one new icon, the ‘Chopper’ variant, outperformed the
  control group by 92 percent in terms of installs. Based on these findings,
  Kongregate changed Global Assault’s icon on Google Play to the ‘Chopper’
  image.

  Jeff Gurian, Senior Marketing Director at Kongregate commented that “as a
  publisher we are responsible for handling the marketing spend of our
  developers. If we can improve conversion rates through art or graphics by even
  0.5% it is extremely valuable to us — and the Store Listing Experiment tool
  gives us the data we need to make those decisions.”
